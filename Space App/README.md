91906_Space_App

By Golden Zheng

This is a GUI Tkinter application that I have been developing for the last 2 terms. 

I would always notice whenever im scrolling through the web using online space websites/apps that there was always one thing lacking in all of them. Sure they all have unique facts about space that are indeed very interesting and fascinating but for me the best way to learn about anything is through practical use and thats when I realized that all the websites and apps ive visited online all lacked interactivity and innovation. Thats what led me to create not just a interactive app as a whole but to also include new information that you might not see anywhere else in the web.

If you want to run the code please download the requirements if that doesn't work then you might have to download them manually just download the ones that im using on my pages you dont have to download all of them in the requirements.txt file. 

I hope you enjoy my app
